# eventease

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/eventease-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.

# Quick Start

### Starting the Service with Docker Compose
To start the service in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

📄 This command starts all services defined in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file in `detached` mode, meaning in the background.

### Retrieving the Database Container IP Address
To retrieve the IP address of the database container, use the following command:

```bash
docker inspect eventease_db | grep IPAddress
```

🔍 **Note**: Use the obtained IP address to connect to the database via pgAdmin.

---

### Connecting to the Database with pgAdmin
1. **Open pgAdmin**.
2. **Create a new server** and use the IP address obtained in the previous step as the server address.
